Thank you for opening an issue. Please be sure to review our [Contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) and be sure to adhere to our [Code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) when interacting with the community.

At this time, only projects that Red Hat employees are required to work on as part of their job will be listed. This includes projects Red Hat stewards as well as projects in which Red Hat is just one contributor among others. For now, don't list sub-projects if at all possible. Eventually we will get to that, but for now, top-level projects only, please.

Please don't add projects for which you volunteer. There are so many amazing projects that Red Hatters work on as enthusiasts, ourselves included, but too many to recognize here. 

Check the site https://redhatofficial.github.io first to ensure this project is not already listed. You can also check the source file: https://github.com/RedHatOfficial/RedHatOfficial.github.io/blob/dev/app/data/projects.json

To add a new project we need: 
  - Project name
  - Project description
  - Link to the github repository
  - Link to the project's website
  - General category for this project

Project name, repository, and category are required but other fields are highly recommended.

Current categories include:
- Development
- Documentation
- Middleware
- Operations
- Organizations
- Platform
- Storage
